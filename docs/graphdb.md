# Semantic Storage of regulation graphs

The regulation graphs obtained within the Rule Formalisation Tool in the form of JSON-LD files are uploaded to [Graphwise GraphDB(TM)](https://graphwise.ai/components/graphdb/) via REST API provided by [GraphDB Workbench REST API](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/10.6/using-the-graphdb-rest-api.html). 

The steps of the transformation are given at the picture
